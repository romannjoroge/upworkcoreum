# Upwork Coreum

This is an escrow service made on the Coreum blockchain. It allows users to create escrows that could be thought of as jobs in Upwork. To create an escrow the user must deposit CORE into it. Any other user can apply for the escrow and the creator picks one to do the intended task. Once the task is complete the user marks the escrow as done and the contract automatically moves the funds to the user who completed the task.
